=head1 NAME

podweaver - Run Pod::Weaver on a file or distribution.

=head1 VERSION

version 0.99_04

=head1 SYNOPSIS

podweaver [options]

 Options:
   -v, --verbose     increase verbosity
   --new             write to *.new files rather than overwriting existing
   --no_backup       skip generating *.bak files when editing files
   --antispam=str    replace @ in author emails with 'str'.
   --help            brief help message
   --man             full documentation
   --version         display version information and exit

=head1 OPTIONS

=over 8

=item B<--new>

Write the modified version of a file to a new file based on the original
filename with a C<.new> extension, rather than the default behaviour of
overwriting the original.

When B<--new> is supplied, no *.bak backup of the original is created (since
the original is left untouched.)

=item B<--no_backup>

Skips the production of *.bak backups for any changed files.
Be warned, this could result in loss of the file contents if anything goes
wrong, use with caution. (Or better still, use with your changes safely
commited to the VCS of your choice.)

=item B<--antispam=>I<string>

Replaces the @ in author email addresses with the supplied string as an
anti-spam measure.
Given that the original email is still within the META.yml, this will not
prevent all spam harvesting, but it may at least help.

=item B<-v>, B<--verbose>

Increases the level of messages displayed.

=item B<--help>, B<-h>, B<-H>, B<-?>

Print a brief help message and exits.

=item B<--man>

Prints the manual page and exits.

=item B<--version>

Prints version information and the location of the config file and
exits.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

L<podweaver> will run L<Pod::Weaver> across all files in a distribution,
editing them in place and leaving a backup of the original in
I<original>.bak.

This was designed to run with the
L<Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::ReplaceBoilerplate> plugin, so you can
run L<podweaver> as part of your release process to update the boilerplate
and other automatically generated POD in your source files, rather than
the default L<Pod::Weaver> behaviour of appending.

To use L<podweaver> it is suggested you place a C<weaver.ini> file in
the root of your distribution with contents similar to:

  [@ReplaceBoilerplate]

If no C<weaver.ini> is provided then the default L<Pod::Weaver> settings
are used, which will continuously append duplicate sections each time you
run L<podweaver>.

L<podweaver> expects to be run in the root of your distribution, and will
look for a META.json or META.yml file to extract details such as the author,
licence and version.  If no META file is found then it will issue a warning,
but still run, which may result in some sections being missing from the
final POD, it is recommended that you run L<podweaver> again after you've
generated your META file.

Currently L<podweaver> looks in the C<lib>, C<bin> and C<script> dirs for
modules or scripts that should be woven.
This should probably be configurable.

Please see the documentation in L<App::podweaver> for bugs and issues.

=head1 CONFIGURATION FILE

If you find yourself using the same command-line options repeatedly
you can set them as defaults in an application configuration file.

This file is located in C<$HOME/.app_podweaver/podweaver.ini> for
UNIX-based operating systems, and
C<~/Local Settings/Application Data/App-podweaver/podweaver.ini> under Windows.

You can find the exact location of your configuration file using
the B<--version> option.

The configuration file follows L<Config::Tiny> style .ini format and
consists of command-line option names for keys, for example:

  antispam  = BLAHBLAH
  no_backup = 1
  verbose   = 2

This would be as if you provided C<< --antispam=BLAHBLAH --no_baackup -vv >>
on the command-line.

Any options supplied on the command-line will override those supplied
within the configuration file.
