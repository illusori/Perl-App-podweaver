App-podweaver

App::podweaver provides a mechanism to run Pod::Weaver over the files
within a distribution, without needing to use Dist::Zilla.

Where Dist::Zilla works on a copy of your source code, App::podweaver
is intended to modify your source code directly, and as such it is highly
recommended that you use the Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::ReplaceBoilerplate
plugin bundle so that you over-write existing POD sections, instead of the
default Pod::Weaver behaviour of repeatedly appending.
