NAME
    App::podweaver - Run Pod::Weaver on the files within a distribution.

VERSION
    version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
    App::podweaver provides a mechanism to run Pod::Weaver over the files
    within a distribution, without needing to use Dist::Zilla.

    Where Dist::Zilla works on a copy of your source code, App::podweaver is
    intended to modify your source code directly, and as such it is highly
    recommended that you use the
    Pod::Weaver::PluginBundle::ReplaceBoilerplate plugin bundle so that you
    over-write existing POD sections, instead of the default Pod::Weaver
    behaviour of repeatedly appending.

    You can configure the Pod::Weaver invocation by providinng a
    `weaver.ini' file in the root directory of your distribution.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module, run the following commands:

      perl Build.PL
      ./Build
      ./Build test
      ./Build install

BOOTSTRAPPING WITH META.json/META.yml
    Since the META.json/yml file is often generated with an abstract
    extracted from the POD, and App::podweaver expects a valid META file for
    some of the information to insert into the POD, there's a
    chicken-and-egg situation on the first invocation of either.

    Running App::podweaver first should produce a POD with an abstract line
    populated from your `# ABSTRACT:' header, but without additional
    sections like version and authors. You can then generate your META file
    as per usual, and then run App::podweaver again to produce the missing
    sections:

      $ ./Build distmeta
      Creating META.yml
      ERROR: Missing required field 'dist_abstract' for metafile
      $ podweaver -v
      No META.json or META.yml file found, are you running in a distribution directory?
      Processing lib/App/podweaver.pm
      $ ./Build distmeta
      Creating META.yml
      $ podweaver -v
      Processing lib/App/podweaver.pm

    This should only be neccessary on newly created distributions as both
    the META and the neccessary POD abstract should be present subsequently.
